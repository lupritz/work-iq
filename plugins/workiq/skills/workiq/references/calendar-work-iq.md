# Calendar

Known-date listings use `fetch` `/me/calendarView` with the requested start/end,
not `ask`. Resolve each boundary's UTC offset for its own requested date and
timezone; do not reuse today's offset across daylight-saving transitions.
Preserve recurrence/instance intent and clarify a genuinely missing date or
referent rather than inventing "that week" or "these attendees".

Exact event reads and comparison sets must verify identity, participant and time
constraints. Read the selected event's body for agenda, not an unrelated meeting.
For actions, establish intent, resolve exact event/recipient IDs, verify organizer
status where required, prepare and obtain required confirmation. `202` means
accepted/pending. No replay after ambiguous results; see [recovery](troubleshooting.md).

## Known endpoint recipes

Call counts below describe an unambiguous, authorized happy path, not a hard limit.
Identity, required confirmation, supported paging and requested completeness take
precedence. Endpoint query restrictions and payload shapes remain binding.

| Request | Example | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finding a 30-minute slot for the whole team | "Find a 30-min slot when the whole team is free this week" | Do not use `ask`. Resolve `/me`, `/me/manager`, and the manager's `/users/{managerId}/directReports` with at most two `fetch` calls, then call `do_action` `/me/calendar/getSchedule` exactly once with all schedulable addresses and `AvailabilityViewInterval: 30`. Compute the earliest common working-hours slot from that response; skip `search_paths`, `get_schema`, `findMeetingTimes`, and a second verification action. |
| Finding the most recent meeting with a person and explaining its agenda | "Which candidate event was my latest meeting with Alex, and what was it about?" | Use structured `fetch`, not `ask`. Fetch bounded candidates or a calendar window with `subject,start,end,body,bodyPreview,attendees,organizer`; retain actual attendee matches, sort by start descending, and answer from the selected event body. |
| Comparing people across two exact calendar events | "Who appears in both of these two event URLs?" | Use one batched `fetch` for both exact `/me/events/{id}?$select=subject,organizer,attendees` URLs. Build each people set from organizer plus attendees, normalize by lowercase email, compute the intersection locally, and report non-overlaps. Do not use `ask`. |
| Tentatively accepting a meeting by title | "Mark the Office hours sync as tentative" | `fetch` the exact event ID, then `do_action` `/me/events/{id}/tentativelyAccept` with `{"sendResponse":false}`. Do not include an empty `comment`; do not call `get_schema` for this known contract. |
| Declining a meeting by title without a response message | "Decline the upcoming Daily standup invite" | `fetch` the exact event ID, then `do_action` `/me/events/{id}/decline` with `{"sendResponse":false}`. Omit `comment`; do not call `get_schema` or retry alternate payloads. |
| Cancelling an organizer-owned meeting by title | "Cancel the Friday staff meeting I organized" | `fetch` the exact event ID, then `do_action` `/me/events/{id}/cancel` with `{"Comment":""}`. This is a known contract: do not call `search_paths` or `get_schema`. A `202` response confirms acceptance; do not fetch again solely to verify. |
| Forwarding a calendar invite by title | "Forward the Sprint Planning invite to Casey Foster" | Use one batched `fetch` to resolve both the exact event (`/me/events?$filter=subject%20eq%20'{odataEscapedAndUrlEncodedSubject}'&$select=id,subject,start,end,organizer,attendees,isOrganizer&$top=10`) and the exact recipient (`/users?$filter=displayName%20eq%20'{odataEscapedAndUrlEncodedDisplayName}'&$select=id,displayName,mail,userPrincipalName&$top=5`). Copy the returned event `id` verbatim, including any trailing `=`, and call `do_action` `/me/events/{eventId}/forward` with `{"ToRecipients":[{"emailAddress":{"name":"{displayName}","address":"{mailOrUserPrincipalName}"}}],"Comment":""}`. This is a known contract: skip `get_schema`, `calendarView`, mail lookup, `ask`, and verification fetches; do not rewrite `=` as `%3D` or retry encoded ID variants. |
