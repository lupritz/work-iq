# Teams (chats, channel messages, reactions, presence)

Use the WorkIQ **entity tools** for Teams requests — sending/reading chat messages, posting in
channels, replying, reacting, and presence. Use `ask` only for synthesis questions
("what's the team's take on the release?"), not for sending or listing messages.

Establish intent first. "Reply messages last week" can mean finding existing
content, not posting; remain read-only and clarify an unclear effect. Confirm
the exact target/content for mutations, including creating a chat, read state,
hide and presence. An absent user is not approval. Call counts are happy-path
goals subordinate to identity, confirmation and supported complete paging.
Follow [recovery](troubleshooting.md): denial stops and ambiguous writes are not
replayed. Missing identity/tenant fields block the action, not invite guesses.

Known Teams mutations — message edits, `hideForUser`, mark read or unread,
and reactions — must use the documented workflows below directly. Do not call
`search_paths` or `get_schema` for them.

## ⚠️ Chats and channels are different surfaces

The most common Teams routing mistake is mixing these up:

| Surface | What it is | Path root |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat** | 1:1, group, or meeting chat — flat message list | `/me/chats`, `/chats/{chatId}/messages` |
| **Channel** | A channel inside a team — messages have threaded **replies** | `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages` |

- A name like "Project X Daily" can be either a chat **or** a channel. Resolve it before acting
  with **Finding a chat** or **Finding a channel** below.
- **Replies:** channel messages support
  `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}/replies` (POST a reply there).
  **Chat messages have no replies endpoint** — chats are flat, so "replying" in a chat means
  posting a new message to the same chat.
- IDs are not interchangeable: a chat ID does not work in a `/teams/...` path or vice versa.

## Canonical paths

| Operation | Tool | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List my chats | `fetch` | `/me/chats?$expand=members` |
| Find, create, or reuse a 1:1 chat | `create_entity` | parentUrl `/chats` |
| List messages in a chat | `fetch` | `/chats/{chatId}/messages` (don't use $top parameter) |
| Send a chat message | `create_entity` | parentUrl `/chats/{chatId}/messages` |
| List my teams / a team's channels | `fetch` | `/me/joinedTeams`, `/teams/{teamId}/channels` |
| List channel messages | `fetch` | `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages` |
| Post a channel message | `create_entity` | parentUrl `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages` |
| Reply to a channel message | `create_entity` | parentUrl `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}/replies` |
| Edit a chat message | `update_entity` | `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}` |
| Edit a channel message | `update_entity` | `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}` |
| React to a message | `do_action` | `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}/setReaction` (or the channel-message equivalent) |
| Remove a chat from my list | `do_action` | `/chats/{chatId}/hideForUser` |
| Mark a chat read or unread | `do_action` | `/chats/{chatId}/markChatReadForUser`, `/chats/{chatId}/markChatUnreadForUser` |
| List channel members | `fetch` | `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/members` |
| Channel-message delta ("what's new since…") | `call_function` | `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/delta` |
| Read presence | `fetch` | `/me/presence`, `/users/{id}/presence` |
| Set my presence | `do_action` | `/me/presence/setUserPreferredPresence` |

## Finding Teams targets

Every Teams task below starts from these lookups. Apply them to all Teams
reads and mutations:

- Match names and message text exactly. Never act on a partial, similar, or
  semantic match.
- Do not use `ask` to find a chat, channel, or message that will be changed.
  If the exact target is not found, report it as not found.
- Omit `$top` on `/me/joinedTeams`, `/chats/{chatId}/messages`, and
  `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages`.

### Finding a channel

1. Fetch exactly `/me/joinedTeams?$select=id,displayName` and select the exact
   team name. Do not add `$top`; the deployed endpoint rejects it.
2. Fetch `/teams/{teamId}/channels?$select=id,displayName` and select the exact
   channel name. Do not choose the first similar channel name.

### Finding a chat

Pick the lookup that matches how the user named the chat.

**By person (authorized 1:1 create-or-return).** Microsoft Graph permits only one one-on-one chat for
a pair of users. If it already exists, this call returns that existing chat
instead of creating a duplicate. Require a non-empty returned chat ID and
`chatType == "oneOnOne"`. This is a mutation, not a read-only lookup. Use it only
when creating/reusing that chat is authorized (for example, a confirmed send or
read-state change that also permits chat creation). For finding existing
messages, read-only requests, edits or reactions without chat-creation approval,
resolve an existing chat through `/me/chats?$expand=members` and supported paging,
matching the verified directory counterpart. Do not create a chat merely to
find old content or silently add this effect to another mutation.

1. Resolve the signed-in user and a verified directory-user counterpart:
   - When the user supplied an email address or UPN, fetch `/me?$select=id` and
     `/users/{urlEncodedUserPrincipalName}?$select=id,displayName,mail,userPrincipalName`.
   - Otherwise, fetch `/me?$select=id` and
     `/users?$filter=displayName%20eq%20%27{odataEscapedAndUrlEncodedExactDisplayName}%27&$select=id,displayName,mail,userPrincipalName&$top=10`.
2. Require exactly one returned directory user matching the supplied email/UPN
   or, for a name lookup, the complete `displayName`. If no user or multiple users match, ask for
   an email address or UPN instead of guessing. Do not use `/me/people`;
   People results can be fuzzy or represent contacts rather than directory
   users.
3. Call `create_entity` with `parentUrl="/chats"` and exactly these two members,
   using only the returned directory-user `id` for `{counterpartUserId}`:

```json
{
  "chatType": "oneOnOne",
  "members": [
    {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.aadUserConversationMember",
      "roles": ["owner"],
      "user@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('{signedInUserId}')"
    },
    {
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.aadUserConversationMember",
      "roles": ["owner"],
      "user@odata.bind": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users('{counterpartUserId}')"
    }
  ]
}
```

**By topic (group chat).** In the initial `fetch` call, request
`/me?$select=id` and
`/me/chats?$filter=topic%20eq%20%27{odataEscapedAndUrlEncodedExactTopic}%27&$expand=members&$top=50`,
and require an exact `topic` match. If the response includes
`@odata.nextLink`, follow the global pagination and partial-result guidance in
`references/fetch-work-iq.md`.

**Your member identity in the chat.** `hideForUser`, `markChatReadForUser`,
and `markChatUnreadForUser` need the signed-in member whose `userId` equals
`{signedInUserId}`. If the chat lookup already returned members (as the topic
lookup does), use them. Do not fetch `/chats/{chatId}/members` again.
Otherwise, fetch exactly `/chats/{chatId}/members` with no query string. The URL must end at
`/members`; do not append any query string, including `$select`, `$expand`, or
`$top`. `userId` and
`tenantId` are returned by the unfiltered response but are not selectable
`conversationMember` properties. Put that member's `userId` in
`teamworkUserIdentity.id` and use the same member's returned `tenantId`. Never
use the conversation member's opaque `id` value (often beginning with `MCMj`);
Graph can interpret it as another user and return HTTP 403.

### Finding a message

First find the channel or chat, then fetch its messages and match the complete
message text exactly:

- Channel: `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages?$select=id,createdDateTime,body`
- Chat: `/chats/{chatId}/messages?$select=id,createdDateTime,body`

Use the matching message's `id` in the follow-up call.

## Listing chats and channel members

For "show my Teams chats", the bounded happy path is one `fetch` on
`/me/chats?$expand=members` and answer from the returned `topic`, `chatType`,
and `members`. Do not follow or construct `$skip`, and do not add member
`$select` fields such as `email` or `userId`; those fields are not exposed on
`conversationMember`. No enrichment is needed after success. Follow supported
returned `@odata.nextLink` for all/every/complete requests or disclose partial
coverage if continuation is unsupported or a budget prevents it. A bounded
listing is not proof of absence or a complete history.

For a named channel-member listing, the happy path is three `fetch` calls:
**Finding a channel**, then exactly
`/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/members`. The deployed members endpoint
does not allow `$top`; do not add it. Do not request `email` or `userId` with
`$select` because those are not properties of `conversationMember`. Use the
returned `displayName` and identity data directly. Do not retry field or query
variants after a 400.

## Sending a message to a person — reuse the existing chat

To "send a chat to Alex" or message yourself:

1. Find the chat **by person**. Graph returns the existing chat when one
   already exists and creates it only when needed.
2. POST the message to that chat with `create_entity` on `/chats/{chatId}/messages`.
3. Never create a group chat to deliver a single 1:1 message.

Message body shape (chat and channel):
`{"body": {"contentType": "text", "content": "..."}}`.

## Reacting to a message

1. Find the target: **Finding a channel** for a channel message, or
   **Finding a chat** for a chat message.
2. Follow **Finding a message** to get the exact message `id`.
3. Call `do_action` on the matching path, using the reaction body in
   `references/do-action-work-iq.md`:
   - Channel: `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}/setReaction`
   - Chat: `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}/setReaction`

The known deployed body uses a literal reaction, e.g. `{"reactionType":"👍"}`,
not `like`. Confirm the reaction and exact message before executing once.

## Edit a message

### Edit a chat message

Use **Finding a chat**, then **Finding a message**, and call `update_entity`
on `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}`.

### Edit a channel message

Use **Finding a channel**, then **Finding a message**, and call `update_entity`
on `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}`.

For both surfaces, use
`{"body":{"contentType":"text","content":"..."}}` as the update body. Do not
call `search_paths` or `get_schema` for these known edit paths.

## Removing/Deleting/Hiding a chat from the current user's chat list

"Delete this chat from my list", "remove this chat", and "hide this chat" map
to the per-user `hideForUser` action, never `delete_entity`.

1. Find the exact chat with **Finding a chat**. For a named topic, use the
   single batched topic lookup documented there.
2. Resolve your member identity. For a topic lookup, reuse the expanded member
   whose `userId` matches the signed-in user.
3. Call `do_action` on `/chats/{chatId}/hideForUser` with the `hideForUser`
   payload in `references/do-action-work-iq.md`.
4. Stop after the successful `204` response.

For a topic lookup, do not issue a separate `/me` or
`/chats/{chatId}/members` fetch. Do not make a verification fetch.

## Marking a named 1:1 chat read or unread

This is a known deployed contract. Do not call `search_paths` or `get_schema`.

After confirmation of all effects, the mark-read happy path is:

1. `fetch` the signed-in user and exact counterpart with **Finding a chat —
   By person**.
2. `create_entity` on `/chats` to create or return the one-on-one chat.
3. `fetch` exactly `/chats/{chatId}/members` and resolve your member identity.
4. `do_action` on `/chats/{chatId}/markChatReadForUser`.

For mark-unread, use the same first three steps, then fetch
`/chats/{chatId}/messages?$select=createdDateTime` and call
`/chats/{chatId}/markChatUnreadForUser` with the first returned message
timestamp. The chat resource's `lastUpdatedDateTime` is not a message timestamp
and is not a valid substitute.

Use the action bodies in `references/do-action-work-iq.md`. Do not call
`search_paths` or `get_schema`, omit `tenantId`, or probe unsupported member
fields. If the action returns HTTP 500 or another ambiguous result, do not
replay it. Re-fetch the chat state when it is observable; otherwise report the
outcome as indeterminate.

If chat creation is not authorized, resolve the existing chat read-only instead;
if none is found in scope, stop. The Teams action payloads in `references/do-action-work-iq.md` are known
deployed contracts; call them directly. Use `get_schema` only for an
undocumented action shape.

## Inspecting channel-message create properties

For "What properties can I set when creating a Teams channel message?", make
exactly one `get_schema` call for
`/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages` with
`operationType="create"`. Do not probe chat or update schemas.

Use that create schema as the source of truth for the answer. Lead with
user-supplied content fields such as `body`, `attachments`, `mentions`, and
other fields explicitly supported by the create payload. Do not present
system-generated or read-only resource fields as settable; this includes
identifiers, timestamps, sender and location metadata, reactions, replies,
hosted contents, and message history. If the returned schema exposes a broad
resource model without reliable writability annotations, state that limitation
instead of claiming every exposed property can be supplied on create.

## Exact marker messages and supplied URLs

For exact marker messages, resolve the exact team/channel, then fetch
`/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages?$select=id,createdDateTime,body`.
Omit `$top` and `$orderby`; filter locally to the complete exact marker. Do not
use semantic search, which can miss recent posts or mix unrelated history.
Do not fetch replies unless requested. Follow supported paging for requested
coverage, otherwise label the evidence partial.

For supplied exact message URLs, batch every supported exact entity path in
one `fetch`, then synthesize locally. Use `/teams/{teamId}/channels/{channelId}/messages/{messageId}`
for channel messages and `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}` for chat messages;
do not swap surfaces, guess IDs from ambiguous links or search broader history.
Inspect every result and preserve successes; unresolved targets remain explicit.

For API inventories, use `search_paths` with `{"query":"/chats"}` or
`{"query":"/teams/{team-id}/channels"}` as requested. Report every confirmed
operation/category, state unconfirmed categories and inspect saved capped output
when available. No extra path/schema call merely to fill an unsupported category.

## Presence

- "Set my presence to Busy/Away/DoNotDisturb" → `do_action` on
  `/me/presence/setUserPreferredPresence` with
  `{"availability": "Busy", "activity": "Busy", "expirationDuration": "PT1H"}`.
  This is the user-preferred presence and the right route for user requests.
- `/me/presence/setPresence` is the **application session** variant and requires a `sessionId` —
  only use it if you have one. If a presence write has an ambiguous result, do
  not replay it; fetch the current presence when possible and otherwise report
  the outcome as indeterminate. Do not cycle through alternate presence
  endpoints.
